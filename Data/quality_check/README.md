# Notes during the manual quality check

- Next time I generate figures of FA, MD, RD, AD, I should set the intensity limits. Otherwise, if there are NaN values in the image, the whole image will look white or dark.
- Exclusion criteria:
    - Failed alignment to MNI152
    - low-quality DTI scalar images
